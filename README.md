# CSGO-Pickem-Challenge
This is a finished project that uses the Material Design Lite framework and allows for users to edit their CSGO ESL One Cologne 2016 Pickem Predictions without having to open the CSGO client.

Feel free to fork this project and learn from it, or even submit changes to help me learn. I have finished with this project, it could, however, still do with some improvement.
